-- B2 - deduct_fefo()
-- Plan: Lean Compliance Plan, Phase B / B2
--
-- Consumes stock oldest-expiry-first and reports which batches were hit, at
-- what cost. Callers use the returned rows to stamp batch_id and cogs_rate
-- onto the sale line.
--
-- This function does NOT touch products.quantity. The existing
-- update_product_stock trigger on sales already maintains that aggregate;
-- doing it here as well would double-count.
--
-- Deviation from the plan's draft: the plan's query selects bare
-- effective_cost / gst_rate while OUT parameters of the same name are in
-- scope, which Postgres rejects as an ambiguous column reference. The table
-- is aliased and every column qualified below.
