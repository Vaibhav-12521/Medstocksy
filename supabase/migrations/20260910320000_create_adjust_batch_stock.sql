-- ============================================================
-- adjust_batch_stock() - shared batch-ledger helper
-- Supporting function for B3 (purchase returns) and B4 (sales returns).
--
-- Deliberately forgiving: if a product has no batch rows yet (legacy stock
-- that predates the backfill, or an account mid-rollout), it adjusts nothing
-- and returns 0 rather than raising. products.quantity remains authoritative
-- in that case, so returns keep working while batches are being adopted.
